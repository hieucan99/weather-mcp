# Core MCP Concepts
MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:
Resources: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
Tools: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
Prompts: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks

## Setting Up Your MCP Server
## Update your package.json to add type: “module” and a build script
